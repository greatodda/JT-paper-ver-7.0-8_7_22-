We thank both referees for their highly helpful responses! We have made most of the changes suggested. Here are some responses to specific points.

REFEREE 1

> 4. Page 7 Conjecture 3.3. It's a bit surprising that this is a conjecture. Could you please say more about why this case is particularly hard or why the framework cannot be used?

We tried, but it is not easy to say something meaningful here beyond "it does not work".

> 5. Page 14. The example M is not strict for your explanation of Lemma 3.15.

Why not? Are we missing something?

> 6. Page 17 line -1. Delete "by a straightforward computation". I think it's already clear enough.

It's meant to prevent the reader from looking up in a vain search of what is being used.

REFEREE 2

> 1. Might be useful to mention what the Lang–Weil estimate and the Schwarz–Zippel bounds tell us about the probability that
det Jλ is 0.

Lang-Weil, in the form I know it, is a tad too abstract and asymptotic to give something concrete here ("there exist some constants such that..."). Schwartz-Zippel yields that the vanishing probability for s_\lambda is at most \ell(\lambda)/q; this already appears in Lemma 5.3 of the Anzis/Chen/Gao/Kim/Li/Patrias paper. This bound is a far cry from the values we have been able to prove.

> 3. p. 5: Before Definition 2.9, you say your definition is more restrictive than [1, Definition 2.3]. In what way? Mention this in the paper.

Good catch -- it was actually less, not more restrictive!

> 6. p. 9: In Definition 3.7 you write “the matrix have at least”. Here “have” should be “has”.

Subjunctive mood.

> 10. p. 21: In beginning of section 4 you say you generalize Corollary 3.3 of [1], but you don’t say what this corollary says. Please describe the corollary.

Now saying "that generalizes [1, Corollary 3.3] from partitions to skew partitions". This should hopefully explain what that corollary is saying.
